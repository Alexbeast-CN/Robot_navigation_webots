The coverage planning algorithm here is the main to solve problems in 2D areas. There are two methods explained in this book.

## 1. Boustrophedon decomposition 

### 1.1 Concept

Boustrophedon means the way ox walks which is the parallel-line-covered areas. The pattern is illustrated in the figure below.

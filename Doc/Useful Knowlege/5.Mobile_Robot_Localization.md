## 5.Mobile Robot Localization
This section of notes contains information on how to position the mobile robot.

### 5.1 An error model for odemetric position estimation
It is instructive to establish an error model for odometrc accuracy and see how the errors propagate over time. <br>Generally the pose of a robot is represented by the vector:
$$
p = \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ \theta \end{bmatrix} \tag{5.1}$$
Same method as on the labsheet to get the new coordinates after the update, thus the updated position 
$$
p' = (x,y,\theta, \Delta s_r, \Delta s_l)  = \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ \theta \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\Delta s_r+\Delta s_l}2cos(\theta+\frac{\Delta s_r-\Delta s_l}{2b}) \\ \frac{\Delta s_r+\Delta s_l}2sin(\theta+\frac{\Delta s_r-\Delta s_l}{2b}) \\ \frac{\Delta s_r-\Delta s_l}{b}\end{bmatrix}
$$
